XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name clk_i [get_ports clk_i] (Source: D:/lianxi/RISCVPractice/TraceCPU/TraceCPU.srcs/constrs_1/new/clk.xdc (Line: 1))

Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name clk_i [get_ports clk_i] (Source: D:/lianxi/RISCVPractice/TraceCPU/TraceCPU.srcs/constrs_1/new/clk.xdc (Line: 1))
